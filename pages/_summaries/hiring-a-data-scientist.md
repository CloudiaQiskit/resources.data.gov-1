resource_name: Federal Chief Data Officers (CDO) Council- Hiring a Data Scientist in the Federal Government Toolkit
description:The Federal Chief Data Officers (CDO) Council has introduced the Data Science Hiring Toolkit to assist federal agencies in recruiting and hiring data science talent more effectively. This Toolkit was developed in collaboration with Excellence in Government (EIG) Fellows across various agencies and with input from key organizations like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and provides guidance on critical aspects of the hiring process including fostering diversity, defining roles accurately, selecting appropriate job classifications, and preparing both candidates and hiring managers. The toolkit will be regularly updated to reflect evolving data science practices with further input from OMB, OPM, OSTP, and other federal partners.
